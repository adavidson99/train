# train
animated railway scene using OpenGL

There are a number of objects and animations that are included in my railway scene. These elements include a circular loop track, with a model train moving around it. The train includes a locomotive and four wagons attached to it. There is also a railway station included in the scene at which the train stops at for a few seconds every loop. A tunnel and a road are also features included. The train goes through the tunnel and the road crosses the rail tracks. Finally, there are two barrier arms next to the road on either sides of the track which are animated to descend every time the train passes.
