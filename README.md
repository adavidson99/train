# train
animated railway scene using OpenGL

There are a number of objects and animations that are included in my railway scene. These elements include a circular loop track, with a model train moving around it. The train includes a locomotive and four wagons attached to it. There is also a railway station included in the scene at which the train stops at for a few seconds every loop. A tunnel and a road are also features included. The train goes through the tunnel and the road crosses the rail tracks. Finally, there are two barrier arms next to the road on either sides of the track which are animated to descend every time the train passes. 

## Movement
The function keys to navigate the scene include:

Up arrow: Move camera forward in the current direction

Down arrow: Move camera backward in the current direction

Left arrow: Change the current direction towards left by a certain angle

Right arrow: Change the current direction towards right by a certain angle

Page-up: Increase camera height

Page-down: Decrease camera height

‘c’: switch view modes between the default, cab view, and train station view
